#Purpose

The purpose of the project is to produce and deploy a web application that allows users to browse the Amazon product catalog. As a user, we should (at absolute minimum) be able to access your web application and see a list of products, including product images and product names. We should also be able to interact with a list to go to the product page on www.amazon.com. 

#User Narrative

A user will be able to browse a list of Tatcha product catalog. A user will see a list of items, prices, and images. A user will be able to interact with the list to see the product on amazon.com. 

#Constraints
Give the time contraint of an hour to complete the project, items would normally be requested via AJAX. After reviewing documentation for Amazon API, more time would have to be invested to configure and authenticating REST Requests via timestamps and signatures. Items in this example were generated from Amazon Product Advertising API, organized as a json object, and set in the controller.  

#Future Development
Dynamic Search through Amazon API
